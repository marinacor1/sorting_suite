Title: Sorting Suite - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort


This suite includes three projects:

* Bubble Sort - organizes an array of characters in ascending order by comparing the current and previous characters and swapping them accordingly.

* Insertion Sort - organizes an array of characters in ascending order by pulling one element at a time from an initial array, then inserting it into the correct position in the new array.

* Merge Sort - organizes an array by splitting an array into two arrays and sorting the halves by also splitting them in half and sorting those halves by splitting them in half and so on. We split until we are left with just single characters to compare. We then compare those two characters and put them back into an array together. The same operation continues on remaining split. We merge the two sorted halves together to create a final sorted array.

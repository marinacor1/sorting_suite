end







#take unsorted array
#split ua into two (if uneven left will be heavier)
#take left half and split until groups of all twos (if uneven than one is allowed in addition)
#take the first pair and compare/ switch accordingly
#merge the pair
#take the second pair and compare/ switch accordingly
#merge the pair
#if there is one then leave it alone
#merge loner to group
#TODO some how get the merged couples to compare with other merged couples (How does this order go?)

#if already sorted, it will just split and then merge

#take unsorted array
#split ua into two (if uneven left will be less)
#take left half and split until groups of all twos (if uneven than one is allowed in addition) RECURSION
#take the first pair and compare/ switch accordingly
#merge the pair
#take the second pair and compare/ switch accordingly
#merge the pair
#if there is one then leave it alone
#[24806]
#TODO some how get the merged couples to compare with other merged couples (How does this order go?) the first of each group compares and switches.
#go backwards: [-2] and [-3] index compare/switch
#[-1] and [-3] index compare/ switch
#[-3] and [-5] or mid and last compare/ switch
#merge loner to group

#once each half is sorted completely, compare the first of each and merge them together 

#if already sorted, it will just split and then merge
